To compile (robotics demonstration):

`make objects` in base directory
`cd plotting`
`make`
`make run`: Warning - generates ~3.0 Mb of uncompressed images in the `out` directory.

I have commented out the code that generates such large amount of files, to protect the end-user.

==== ROBOTARIUM ====
Relevant code for running ROBOTARIUM is in plotting/main.c and plotting/main2_tasks.c

For task control code, look at main2_tasks.c

There you will see the control loop, which generates runtime data for all the robots.
