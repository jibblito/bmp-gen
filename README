Hey, glad you read me.

Here is a cool program suite for creating craphics, all done in C, my favorite
language to write with, becuase it deals a lot with low-level data.... We
make use of that here ;). Anyway, if you want to experiment with some of
the functions and create some images of your own, you can run the tool known
as `make` and then subsequently `make run`: This will generate a photo known
as y.bmp, which you should be oble to open with any regular old image viewer.

HOW TO RUN:

`make` to create binary
`make run` to create an image... 

check out Makefile for other targets.

    Hey, Bobby!

Have fun creating, you little math wizard!
