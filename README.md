# Bmp-Gen

BMP-GEN (pronouced bimp-jin) is a graphics software written in C
by [Rory Hibbler](https://github.com/jibblito). It can be used
to do several things, and is primarily used as a sandbox technology
for creating graphics in the .bmp format.

Recently, functionality has been added to the library for running
real-time simulations at 30 frames per second, allowing to create
animations of simulations live, much like a video game. Bmp-Gen is
awesome, there's only one way to say it, kid.. Whaddya say,
let's get Bimping

# Running bmp-gen

To run bmp-gen, clone this github directory and run the command
`make`, then subsequently `make run` to run the most recent
simulation.

If you get compilation errors, make sure you check that you have
all the proper libraries installed. Notably, you must have X11 and
the Xlib libraries installed, which come with most versions of Linux.

That's all. Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.
